# Summary

This workshop should have provided you with the basic knowledge to use Git and GitHub to do basic version control, including fundamental commands, remote repository, branches and a GUI tool in VS code. 

Here are some useful rules of thumb and best practices to keep in mind:

- Commit early, commit often. Try to keep commits atomic, involving only one task or one fix.
- Make commit messages short but useful. They are your first points of reference if you need to go through previous versions. (If you are using VS code, you can use Copilot tools to automate messages, but be sure to review them manually because they often miss the important points) 
- Branches are not too important for solo researchers working on short calculations simulations. However, for larger code bases, software development, or collaborative work, they are indispensible.
- Use .gitignore to exclude temporary files and keep your workplace clean.
